This was a project for a Project in Databases and Web Applications class.
The site is a movie database where "customers" can browse for and buy movies.
The backend was an apache tomcat server with a MySQL database.
Some interesting features were search autocomplete using ajax to call the database on the fly, and similarly using ajax to retrieve information about a movie when hovered over.
